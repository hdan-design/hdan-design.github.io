## Project Brief

StatisticsHQ is a dashboard for viewing live corporate travel data and gathering actionable insights to influence policy changes and decision making. They approached me to help them redesign their platform to support new features including a marketplace for sharing user-generated content and improved customizability. They also needed help making the platform responsive, and creating a design system to support their development team.

## The Solution

*The main dashboard allows users to see live updates of their organization's travel data, and customize it to suit their needs.*

## Marketplace

*Users can create, share, and download content including dashboards, charts, and plugins to expand the product's functionality.*

## Custom Charts

*During research we found that users have a wide range of goals when it comes to their data, and the ability to fully customize all of their data visuals was extremely valuable to them.*

## Design System

*I collaborated with the development team to create a comprehensive design system based on Google's Material Design standards, allowing for improved efficiency and more consistent user experience.*

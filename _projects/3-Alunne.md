## Project Brief

I was hired by a university to prototype and concept test an app that would unify their wide network of third party academic apps into one branded student experience. This prototype would help them test their concept with real users, and present to their board of directors to secure funding for further developing the app.

## App Overview

*Students can access any app they use day to day, and view all of their tasks and notifications in one place. A chatbot and knowledgebase help answer any questions they have.*

## Task Management

*Tasks and deadlines are tracked across all external apps, accessible from a calendar view. Each task links out to the relevant app.*

## Help Resources

*Students can interact with a chatbot to get assistance completing tasks and ask general questions about the app. They also have access to reference guides, and the ability to search app-wide.*

## Onboarding Process

*Onboarding slides with custom illustrations provide clarity and a simple introduction to the app.*

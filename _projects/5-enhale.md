## Project Brief

Enhale is a startup building a smart inhaler that will allow people with asthma and parents of children with asthma to monitor their intake of prescription medicine and share usage data with their physician. They hired me to design an app to sync with and manage their smart inhaler, and work with their developer to build a functional prototype.

## The Solution

*The app helps people with asthma or parents to monitor their inhaler usage and track risk factors like air quality.*

## Calendar

*Enhale's smart inhaler tracks when users take their prescriptions, and the quality of each dosage. If there are any issues, the apps highlights what specifically users should improve in the future.*

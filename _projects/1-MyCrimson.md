## Overview

> How might we help IUPUI students feel more confident and comfortable using university web tools to access important information and complete required tasks?

### The Challenge
University students have to navigate confusing systems of incompatible and inconsistent apps to manage their academics.

### Our Solution
A simple dashboard to connect all university resources and help students track and manage tasks across all apps.

### My Role
I conducted user research, and designed the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) of the final solution. I worked together with another user researcher to conduct research and synthesize findings.

## The Solution

The final solution is MyCrimson, a simple web app connecting to all of the other university apps. MyCrimson links out to other apps and pulls data from them into one place to organize into tasks to complete and notify students about deadlines and messages.

### Academics at a Glance

MyCrimson allows students to quickly access any app, internal or third party, that they need to manage their education. They can also view progress and deadlines for upcoming required tasks, and use a chatbot to access information in the university knowledge base.

### Easily understand apps

Indiana University relies on a complicated system of custom built apps, external tools, and white-labeled turnkey software to allow students to manage their education.

MyCrimson helps categorize these apps and give students context to understand when to use certain apps, and what to expect when they open it.

We want students to feel in control of their education, and build a clearer mental model of how all of these apps relate to each other.

### Links translated into tasks

There's a lot of important tasks students need to take care of over the course of their college experience, like registering for classes, accepting scholarships, and filling out forms.

Apps can help students complete these tasks, but Task lists clarify what is expected of them and make sure they're getting everything done that they need to.

### Quick search

We help students quickly find exactly what they're looking for, even if they don't know exactly what they're looking for.

This new search helps students understand the functionality of each app, what problems it will solve for them, and what to expect when they open it.

### Every message in one place

MyCrimson gives you one unified inbox to track all communication you receive from your university, whether through your university email, personal email, or tools like Blackboard and Canvas. No more jumping back and forth between different apps, or forwarding everything to the one email you actually check.

### Up to date information

Students receive useful updates and notifications from MyCrimson about what they need to get done across multiple university apps, like completing assignments or registering for classes.

### Works on every device

While we can't make every academic app responsive, we can make sure that students have one place to manage their academics that they can access across all of their devices.

## The process

### Research

![Research Post-its](/images/projects/mycrimson/research1.jpg)

We knew students would be our primary target audience, but we also knew that our solution would have to take into account the needs of the faculty and administrators in order to succeed.

We conducted interviews with students and sent out surveys to hear students needs and frustrations. We also had 1 on 1 interviews with university faculty to better understand how our solution could address their needs as well.

**Our Goals**

- Understand specific student frustrations
- Explore how university web tools impact faculty
- Identify opportunities for the most impact
- Better understand the background & constraints of existing systems

### Personas

#### üéì University Students
##### Primary

Students are the main users of this product, so we have to make sure we understand how they handle their academic now and what opportunities there are to help them.

###### Goals:
- Find the academic information and resources when they need them
- Understand what tasks they have to complete, and when they're due

###### Frustrations:
- Friction navigating between multiple tools that don't work together
- Confusion dealing with inconsistent user experiences
- Unable to find answers when they have issues

#### üë©‚Äçüè´ Academic Advisors
##### Secondary

Advisors are one of the main destinations for students with questions about university web tools. These apps aren't their expertise, and they have much bigger problems to help students with. Allowing students to be more self sufficient will let them focus their time and efforts.

###### Goals:
- To find the academic information and resources they're looking for
- To clearly understand what tasks they have to complete, and when they need to do them

###### Frustrations:
- Having to jump between multiple tools that don't work together
- Dealing with inconsistent user experiences

### Constraints

- Must accommodate an ever-growing ecosystem of incompatible third party software that the university purchases, and first party software built and maintained in-house
- Has to be low maintenance for the university for it to be feasible over the long-term

### Core goals

- Make it easy for students to figure out what tasks they need to complete
- Provide clear, quick, and concise answers to student questions
- Empower students to be more proactive in managing their academics

### The experience

MyCrimson provides a simple way for students to get a birds eye view of their academics. The simple site helps them to create a mental model of the complicated network of university apps and understand how they relate. Task lists align with the way students think about their to-do lists, and relate it to the apps they need to achieve them. Control over content and visuals helps create a sense of security and helps reduce stress and anxiety. The support chat and calendar are accessible through the FAB (floating action buttons) on each screen, to reduce friction between the users and accessing help, or checking deadlines.

### The visuals

I used a large library of full color icons to help clearly identify different apps from each other without being too distracting or busy. Unique colors are pulled at random from a preset palette for things like custom links and task lists, allowing for customization without hurting recognizability. Because of this variety of colors the UI components are composed of just one primary color, white, grey, and a background beige, to improve visual focus and clarity.

### Addressing the constraints

We wanted to make sure our solution was feasible to build, so we considered technical constraints throughout the process. All data pulled into the app is based on real restful APIs for the apps involved. All of the UI can be populated by the existing database the university uses to manage their software, which also makes it easy to add new apps. The support chat function The app is simple and would be easy for the university to maintain over time.

## Conclusion

### Takeaways

The client was pleased with our solution, and We received positive responses from the students and advisors we tested with, as well as the university IT teams who would be responsible for development and management of the platform. While our solution couldn't improve usability for third party apps, we were able to find a way to provide a cohesive core experience and achieve our core goals of student confidence and independence.

### Outcomes

Though the board elected not to move forward with this project due to funding issues, the client has since utilized our research data for other internal student-focused software projects. Our findings have also helped them to hire staff UI and UX designers to help improve the usability and accessibility of their internally developed web tools.

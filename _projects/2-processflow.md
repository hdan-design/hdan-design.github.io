## Overview

> How might we translate a powerful project management desktop platform to an easy to use mobile experience?

### 💬 The Challenge
The team at ProcessFlow wants to make their complex, desktop-first web app responsive for mobile devices, but doesn't know where to start.

### 💡 Our Solution
A targeted mobile experience allowing customers to focus on the features they normally need access to when on the go.

### 👋 My Role
I conducted user research, designed the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) of the final solution, and conducted usability testing.

## Before the Re-design

Customers were used to having quick and total access to their project tables on desktop, and being able to filter and scan for the information they needed. This level of oversight and control helped them stay efficient and productive. But this birds-eye-view experience doesn't translate well to mobile, where there just isn't room for these large tables.

This disconnected user experience is also apparent in other components like the navigation and filtering menus. They take up too much space on mobile devices, and are often inconsistent page-to-page, causing the efficiency and control that customers value most to fail.

## The Solution

The final solution is a re-imagined ProcessFlow for the mobile web, focusing on the core actions and insights that ProcessFlow customers value most.

### Complex projects, simple insights

Dense, detailed tables turn into cards that focus on core information and actions. Key insights are linked at the top to help users save time and focus on taking action.

### Design that gets out of your way

Where the previous interface packed unnecessary information front and center, the updated designs focus screen real estate on the content that users care about most. All of the existing menus and options can be accessed from the main navigation as users need them.

### Contact your team, anywhere

Whether in the office or onsite, we made it easier to quickly reach everyone on your project team. Quickly search and filter by company or role without navigating clunky interactions.

### Clearer navigation

Navigation that's always consistent for customers, scalable for complex use cases, and adaptable if the ProcessFlow team wants to add new features in the future.

### Consistent and adaptable patterns

The core design is based on simple reusable patterns that can scale to the needs of any project. They also make it easier for ProcessFlow to add features and functionality without sacrificing space or confusing users.

## The process

### Research

![Research Post-its](/images/projects/processflow/research.jpg)

ProcessFlow was faced with trying to innovate without alienating their current customers. Because of this, we wanted to make sure we understood what people liked about the platform, how it fit into their work, and where it could be improved.

**Our Goals**

- Observe the day-to-day processes of a construction management team
- Identify core needs, frustrations, and use cases for a mobile experience
- Understand what the core value of ProcessFlow its users, and what they like about using it

### Personas

#### 📝 Project Managers
##### Primary

Project managers are the core users of the ProcessFlow platform. They oversee multiple construction projects and teams of potentially hundreds of people.

> "If I'm away from my desk I just want a heads up if something's on fire."

###### Goals:
- Observe a project's status when they're away from their desk
- Find out when something is wrong without having to call someone to ask

###### Frustrations:
- Hearing from people that there's an issue and not being able to identify it
- Feeling like their productivity is tied to their desk

#### 👷‍♀️ On-site Foremen
##### Secondary

The Foremen are in charge of managing a specific construction site. Though they're not on ProcessFlow often, they find it useful for quickly finding documents, links, and contacts on while on the job.

> "Honestly we're working with so many contractors I just need to know who's who."

###### Goals:
- Contact their team members, and have easy access to everyone's information
- Quickly preview and share documents

###### Frustrations:
- Having to go into their office to complete most tasks
- Stopping what they're doing to try and make sense of a clunky website

### Constraints

- Only the frontend of the platform can change, the backend and core features and functionality must remain the same
- Custom components must be minimized, only utilized when necessary for the user experience to save development time

### Core goals

- Make data tables easier to navigate on a phone
- Focus the interface on core information and actions
- Don't change the core experience too drastically

## Conclusion

### Outcomes

- 45% more use of ProcessFlow on mobile devices
- 61% of customers chose to opt-in to beta test the new design
- 12% lower rates of customer loss to competition over a 6 month period

### Takeaways

We achieved our core goals, helping ProcessFlow build a mobile experience that better suited the needs of their customers. We were also pleased to see a positive impact on trust and interaction between the team and their user-base, and are excited to see the impact of this in their future work.

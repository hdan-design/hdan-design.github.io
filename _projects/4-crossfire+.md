## Overview

> How might we help hospital teams monitor activity across a large scale IoT network?

### ðŸ’¬ The Challenge
A hospital uses a network of smart devices, but has a hard time monitoring activity and access.

### ðŸ’¡ Our Solution
An activity monitoring feature for their system, with simple search and filtering, and insights anyone on the team can understand.

### ðŸ‘‹ My Role
I worked with the client's engineering team, designing the user experience and user interface of the final solution.

## The Solution

Users can view their system's activity as plain-language sentences like "John opened front door". We wanted to make sure everyone from IT teams to security personnel could make sense of this data, to streamline communication and courses of action.

If users need to compare data sets by a certain value, they can also turn on "table mode" to access a more classic row and column layout.

The activity breaks down into simple noun and verb pairings that scale to any device or interaction.

IT teams can also view per-user activity in a smaller UI on a system user's profile page.

### Hi there! And welcome
I'm Henry Dan and this is (going to be) How I Design, a blog series where I explain each step of my process for designing digital products.

### What's this all about?

My goal with this series is to demystify design for all of the non-designers out there. I want to share exactly how I handle a project, going from brief to research to UX strategy to UI Design to user testing, explaining each step along the way and answering any questions. I'm going to be starting with sample problem statements, but handle the entire project as if it were true client work. I'll even have some Twitter polls for anyone to throw me some curveball requirements during the process!

### Who's this for?

Like I mentioned before, my goal is to make something useful for anyone who doesn't design on a day to day basis but wants to know more. I hope this series is also valuable for any junior designers who are interested to see what a design project looks like outside of a classroom context.

I'm going to do everything I can to design a solution that is feasible from a technical perspective, viable from a business perspective, and useful for real users. And by the end, I'll run validation testing and we can see exactly how wrong I was!

Make sense? Sound interesting? Well, it does to me anyway. If you have any questions or comments or anything feel free to send me an email!

##### Looking forward to sharing more about my product in progress!

![Me](/images/about/about.jpg)

My name is Henry Dan and I'm a User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) designer and researcher based in Indianapolis and working remotely.

## But here's what I'm not:

### ▪️ Not a pixel pusher.

Visual design is a huge part of what I do, but it is always in service of solving a problem and creating a better product. Design exists to align business goals, technical constraints, and user needs, not just to create pretty screens.

### 🎸 Not a rockstar.

Some people look at design as a one man magic show, but it's not. Great products can only come from collaboration between business leaders, product teams, and the product's users. If you hire me, we're going to work together to solve big problems.

### ✅ Not a yes man.

Problem solving can only start with the problem, not the solution. And design is problem solving. I will always ask why, and work to understand the goals of any task or project to make sure that my solution is effective and helpful.

### ✋ Not designing for myself.

I make design decisions based on research and evidence, not personal preference. My work is only successful if you and your users are happy with it, and I strive to make sure my designs are driven by real conversations and meaningful data.

### 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 Not ignoring my impact.

Design is about making useful things for real people. We are responsible for the impact of the things we create, and design has the capacity to cause problems as much as it can solve them.

**Inclusion, accessibility,** and **user-centered design** are at the core of everything I create.

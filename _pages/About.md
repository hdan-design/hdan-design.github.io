## Here's what I'm not:

### ▪️ Not a pixel pusher.

Visual design is a huge part of what I do, but it is always in service of solving a problem and creating a better product. Design exists to align business goals, technical constraints, and user needs, not just to create pretty screens.

### 🎸 Not a rockstar.

Some people look at design as a one man magic show, but it's not. Great products can only come from collaboration between business leaders, product teams, and the product's users. If you hire me, we're going to work together to solve big problems.

### ✅ Not a yes man.

Problem solving can only start with the problem, not the solution. And design is problem solving. I will always ask why, and work to understand the goals of any task or project to make sure that my solution is effective and helpful.

### ✋ Not designing for myself.

Every decision I make is based on your goals and the needs of your customers, never personal preference. Everyone is an expert in their own context, and I strive to make sure my designs are driven by conversations with you and the people who use your product.

### 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 Not ignoring my impact.

Design is about making useful things for real people. We are responsible for the impact of the things we create, and design has the capacity to cause problems as much as it can solve them.

**Inclusion, accessibility, and user-centered design** are at the core of everything I create.

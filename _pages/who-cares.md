![Me](/images/about/about2.jpg)

## I'm a designer
## I'm a problem solver
## I work with, not for
I help companies visualize experiences and understand the people who use their products.
## I combine form and function
You buy a chair because it looks good, but you keep it because it's comfortable and sturdy.
## I'm a partner
When I work with clients on projects, we work together. Everyone is an expert in their own experience, and their own context. I want to hear from you and understand the how what and why before I even open my laptop.
